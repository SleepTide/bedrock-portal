# Realm Portal for Minecraft Bedrock

**Current Supported Versions:** 1.21.70

To setup the portal, just edit the config _lib/config.json_

Recommended to run with **pm2** to keep running the background.

This was made on a proxmox LXC (Container) running **Ubuntu Server Minimal 22.04.5** so you may need to install other packages on your system.
